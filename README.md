## workspace-laucher

Launches a bunch of applications and sets a little bit
of an enviroment based on a configuration, nothing but 55 lines of shell, really liked this one

## macro-exec

Launches a menu to choose from a list of one line scripts, adapted from my void rice, easy to add and remove macros, needs python and pyyaml installed
